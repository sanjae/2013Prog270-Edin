<h2 id="windmills">Windmills</h2>
<p>A windmill is a machine that converts the energy of wind into rotational energy by means of sails. Originally, windmills were used for food production. Later, their use was altered to different industrial uses.</p>
<p>4 basic types of vertical windmills:</p>
<ol>
<li>Post mill<ul>
<li>earliest type of European windmill</li>
<li>large upright post on which the mill's main structure is balanced</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hollow-post mill<ul>
<li>the post on which the body is mounted is hollowed out</li>
<li>used in the Netherlands to drain wetlands from the 14th century onwards</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tower mill<ul>
<li>only the cap is rotated rather than the whole body of the mill</li>
<li>he cap can be turned into the wind by winches or gearing inside the cap</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Smock mill<ul>
<li>later development</li>
<li>tower is replaced by a wooden framework, called the "smock"</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="wind-turbines">Wind Turbines</h2>
<p>A wind turbine is a device that converts kinetic energy from the wind into electric current.</p>
<ul>
<li>manufactured in a wide range of vertical and horizontal axis types</li>
<li>the smallest turbines are used as battery charging or auxiliary power on boats</li>
<li>large grid-connected arrays of turbines, (<em>wind farms</em>), are important source of renewable energy.</li>
