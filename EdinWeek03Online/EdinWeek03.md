Windmills And Wind Turbines
===========================

Windmills
---------
A windmill is a machine that converts the energy of wind into rotational energy by means of sails. Originally, windmills were used for food production. Later, their use was altered to different industrial uses.

4 basic types of vertical windmills:

1.  Post mill
    - earliest type of European windmill
    - large upright post on which the mill's main structure is balanced
2.  Hollow-post mill
    - the post on which the body is mounted is hollowed out
    - used in the Netherlands to drain wetlands from the 14th century onwards
3.  Tower mill
    - only the cap is rotated rather than the whole body of the mill
    - he cap can be turned into the wind by winches or gearing inside the cap
4.  Smock mill
    - later development
    - tower is replaced by a wooden framework, called the "smock"

Wind Turbines
-------------
A wind turbine is a device that converts kinetic energy from the wind into electric current.

- manufactured in a wide range of vertical and horizontal axis types
- the smallest turbines are used as battery charging or auxiliary power on boats
- large grid-connected arrays of turbines, (*wind farms*), are important source of renewable energy.
